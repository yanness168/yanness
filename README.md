- Led the Batch Inferencing project, designing and implementing new APIs to optimize model inference workflows.  
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate and deploy microservices on the Watsonx platform using Jenkins, Kubernetes, and Docker, improving service delivery efficiency.  
- Contributed to code reviews and implemented best practices through GitHub, enhancing maintainability and quality.

### Scotiabank
**Data Scientist Intern**  
*September 2023 – April 2024*  
Toronto, ON  
- Conducted in-depth industry analysis for Customer Lifetime Value using Python and SQL, identifying key seasonality in revenue behaviors and enhancing time series model precision by 18% using coefficient of variance, ACF/PACF plots, and time series clustering.  
- Developed two robust versions of Revenue Segmentation model – Individual & Linked – and performed stability tests (PSI) by scoring two consecutive years of data, ensuring model stability with less than 5% deviation.  
- Mastered diverse time series forecasting methodologies, establishing robust baseline models (Naive Forecast, MA, WMA). Elevated model performance by 27% by deploying advanced benchmark models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX).  
- Designed a "Factbook" Power BI dashboard for commercial customers and automated it using PySpark and Airflow.

**Data Scientist Intern**  
*January 2023 – April 2023*  
Toronto, ON  
- Spearheaded classifier and clustering models to predict revenue direction and value level, contributing to the foundation of Customer Lifetime Value – Revenue Segmentation.  
- Performed multi-step data preprocessing on 1,000,000+ rows of data and engineered features using business logic to improve model performance. Utilized Python to develop robust baseline models (Random Forest, LGBM, and XGBoost) as benchmarks.  
- Employed hyperparameter tuning techniques (Optuna, Grid Search) to enhance model accuracy by 23% F1-score on the classifier and integrated classifier outputs into clustering for improved revenue segmentation prediction.  
- Effectively communicated complex data insights to stakeholders, collaborated with team members to refine model metrics, and presented findings to both technical and business audiences, driving CLV development with a 200% increase in stakeholder engagement.

## Technical Skills & Highlights
